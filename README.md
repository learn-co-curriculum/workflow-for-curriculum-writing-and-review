# Workflow in a Nutshell

All curriculum work occurs in Github. The lessons that you will be assigned to work on will be in their own individual repositories in the [learn-co-curriculum organization](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/) in Github which you will be given access to. In most cases, the repositories will have already been created by the time you're ready to work on them. 

When you're creating a lesson, **NEVER** make your commits in the master branch. Instead, create a new branch off of master and title it wip-master. Write your content in this branch, and when you're ready to submit it for review, create a Pull Request to master. In the PR, @ mention AnnJohn, our Curriculum Manager's github name. 

When you're working on a lesson that's a Lab, you will have two branches- master and solution. When writing your solution, create a new branch off of solution and title it wip-solution, and follow the same PR process as above. 

Your content will be reviewed by someone on the Flatiron Team and we'll make comments in the PR. When it's fully been reviewed, we'll assign the PR back to you. If the comments are minor, we'll tell you to fix and merge the PR. Otherwise you'll fix the lesson and then @ mention AnnJohn in the PR. We'll take another review and either merge or assign back with additional comments.
